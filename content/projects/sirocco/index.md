**Game engine**: Unity  
**Team size**: ~20 people

## My contribution to this project

- ### UI & UX
    - Built the entire game's **UI/UX system**: HUD, inventory, multiplayer lobby, friends list, crafting system, settings, and more.
    - Made **custom UI components** significantly more performant than built-in Unity UI components: buttons, images, scroll rects, layouts, and more.
    - Created **custom tools** to make building UI elements easier and faster: theme colors management, text styling templates, localization system, and more.
    - Collaborated with **designers and artists** to build functional UI elements from mockups and wireframes.

- ### Multiplayer platform services
    - Integrated **online platform services** using an in-house backend API: authentication, accounts, parties, friends management, payments, inventory system, and more.
    - **Steam features** integration: Steam friends, invites, rich presence, etc.

- ### Visual effects
    - Created a **high performance** multithreaded system for "boids" VFX (fishes swimming under the ocean surface) using **Unity's Job system**.
